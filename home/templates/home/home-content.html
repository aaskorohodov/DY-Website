    <h1>DY production</h1>

    <p>
        Hey, my name is Arkasha, and I usually tag any stuff I make with "DY". I am currently working as Python developer. In a nutshell, 
        this is how I became one:
    </p>

    <h2>Content-manager</h2>

    <p>
        I was working in <a href="https://zenmod.shop/" target="_blank">Zenmod</a> for more than 4 years, starting as Content-manager. 
        Check out <a href="/content-manager" target="_blank">what I was doing</a> there in details, but in general:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Standardized all the photo-content</li>
        <li>Created style-guides for all the description from all categories</li>
        <li>Grew my department from one-man-job to a company's division</li>
        <li>Took a big part in crating overall design to be client-friendly</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This was the first time I made myself familiar with HTML on business-purposes. It was fun, at first I was creating my own designs 
        for descriptions, blogs and other stuff, using OpenCards build-in functionality, and later these attempts were converted into a real
        design, integrated into own updated web-shop, merch and real-life shops.
    </p>
    
    <h2>SEO</h2>

    <p>At some point, when I got my whole department with several people, who started doing my job (creating content), I was pushed into new area - 
        Search Engine Optimization. I was working with a lot of new tools, like B1, Yandex WordStat, different key-collectors and text-analyzers.
    </p>

    <p>It was a lot of fun, I even took a whole-year courses to become a professional SEO, but there was a catch - all automatic tools were not doing 
        exactly what I needed... SO I started building my own ones! This was the time, when I started diving into Python, as I was already familiar with it 
        and its syntax was pretty easy to work with.
    </p>

    <p>Was that SEO good? Hell yeah it was! If you are familiar with Vaping and live in Russia, than you do know what Zenmod is, and had probably 
        used our web-site to buy stuff. At the point, when we were developing our web-sites, it was the most used one in Russia. If you are familiar with
        SEO-tools (and have payed-license) you can check statistics for zenmod.ru and zenmod.shop for the 2018 - 2022 to sse the results. It was a hard work, with 
        many people involved, but the passion with consistency brought us hight.
    </p>

    <h2>Python</h2>

    <p>After Vaping started experience a huge pressure from government, there was no need in SEO anymore, as the company faced a lot of restriction
        in online marketing. And this is I got into new area - programming!
    </p>

    <p>There is not much I can share, because most of the project I was working on are private, but I can tell you about some!</p>

    <h3>YOLO</h3>

    <p>YOLO is a neural network, that can identify people, objects and traffic on still-images and it does it really fast. By using a single about-modern 
        GPU, YOLO can come with about 60 frames per second. Nice, write? Well, the downside is that it can not track objects from image to image, it treats
        each one as a completely new data. This is where I come in!
    </p>

    <p>Working with YOLO was my biggest project, while I was working in <a href="https://motionlogic.ru/" target="_blank">MotionLogic</a>. My goal was
        to create a service, that could automatically download a video from public cameras, analyze the number of traffic and people on it, 
        so that we can use this data to update our models. BTW, MotionLogic provides data to the customers, that can be used to calculate the effectiveness
        of visual-adds in any city, and the traffic is the most important part.
    </p>

    <p>So, my goal was to create such a service, that could understand raw-data from YOLO, and track objects from one image to the other. It was designed 
        to be used for operators, who would set lines in a video, and each car or human, that would cross this line, would be counted. The most 
    challenging part was to make this service remember each car or a person, so that they won't be counted several times.</p>

    <p>This was the time, when I discovered things like Docker, Docker-compose, Pandas and all the instruments of Atlassian. I started building more complex and 
        completed picture about how CI/CD works in general, how programs interact with each other, send data and how different technologies can work
        together, to create a single Application. It was fun, and pretty challenging.
    </p>

    <h3>Telegram-bots</h3>
    
    <p>Wanna see <span class="pornhub-style-background">some <span class="pornhub-hub">nasty</span></span> content? NSFW, adults only, 18+?</p>
    
    <p>Well, I have some for you, <a href="">if you dare</a>. Unfortunately, this is the only publicly-available Telegram-Bot that I have running, but 
    I was building a lot of them. I like placing one into almost any app I make, because this is a very simple way to set a communication for 
    any User. They allow you to check what is going on with your app and manage it from wherever you are.
